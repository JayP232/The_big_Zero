NOTICE: I have yet to build out this repo and it's respective scripts correctly and the usage of this "exploit kit" will require some changes to file paths and for you to have the correct version of imnpacket installed on your device.

Please note non of the code in this repository is to be used for any malicous or illegal activity and is for educational purposes only !
With that being said everything in this repository is to automate the process of gaining access to a DC using CVE-2020-1472 and if you wish to use it there are a few 
hardcoded directories you will need to change.
